# standview

The standview package in R will generate stand density management
diagrams. These graphic presentations of forest stand-level density come
in two forms. The first format is derived from Reineke-space and these
are generated with a call to dmd.view. The second is derived from
Gingrich-space and these are generated by a call to gdmd.view.

## Installation

If you already have devtools, you can install standview from github
with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("mwritchie/standview")
```

If the devtools package has not already been installed, then the
install.packages(“devtools”) and the library(devtools) call, which are
both shown as comments above, are necessary for installation of
standview.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to generate a Long and Shaw
(2005) density management diagram in Reineke space for ponderosa pine
with annotation on the right only. To assure that the canvas has the
proper aspect ratio, one can call to open a pdf with 6wx8h
configuration. Note that the file produced will be placed in your R
working directory, as defined by setwd():

``` r
library(standview)
#pdf("test20.pdf", width=6, height=8)
opar <- par(mar = c(2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0))

dmd.view(ineq=2, insdr=TRUE, insdl=FALSE)
```

![](README-fig1.show-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r

par(opar)
#dev.off()
```

## Other Information

The current version of standview has a brief vignette. Also, at this
time, the package has not been submitted to CRAN.
