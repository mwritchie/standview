standview
=========

The standview package in R will generate stand density management diagrams. These graphic presentations of forest stand-level density come in two forms. The first format is derived from Reineke-space and these are generated with a call to dmd.view. The second is derived from Gingrich-space and these are generated by a call to gdmd.view.

Installation
------------

If you already have devtools, you can install standview from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mwritchie/standview")
```

If the devtools package is not present, then the install.packages("devtools") call is necessary for installation of standview.

Example
-------

This is a basic example which shows you how to generate a Long and Shaw (2005) density managment diagram in Reineke space for ponderosa pine with annotation on the right only. Note that the file produced will be placed in your working directory for R as defined by setwd():

``` r
library(standview)
pdf("test20.pdf", width=6, height=8)
opar <- par(mar = c(2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0))

dmd.view(ineq=2, insdr=TRUE, insdl=FALSE)

par(opar)
dev.off()
```

Other Information
-----------------

The current version of standview does not have a vignette.
